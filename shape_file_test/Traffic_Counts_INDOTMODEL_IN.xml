Bernardin-Lochmueller and Associates used the Indiana Statewide Travel Demand Model, version 4 (ISTDM4) files in TransCAD to convert
a subset to an ESRI ArcView shapefile. Tables were edited to contain only the fields appropriate for the traffic counts subset.

NOTE -- Updated data were provided by INDOT personnel on July 1, 2016.

<abstract>
TRAFFIC_COUNTS_INDOTMODEL_IN.SHP is a line shapefile that shows Annual Average Daily Traffic Counts on Indiana roads. The data were derived from pre-existing
INDOT basemaps and databases. The data were compiled by Indiana GIS Department of Transportation (INDOT), Road Inventory Section. The Data in the attribute table
are dated for the year 2014.
</abstract>
<purpose>To provide an updated GIS layer showing Annual Average Daily Traffic Counts on Indiana roads in a GIS format.</purpose>

The base_2000 file from the Indiana Statewide Travel Demand Model, version 4, (ISTDM4) was converted in TransCAD to an ESRI ArcView Shapefile.
Roadways were selected to those in Indiana by querying a boolean field for Indiana. All roadways in the model were included in the subset,
however centroid connectors were removed. Numerous attribute fields were removed to result in the basic roadway information.

IGS personnel received an Esri line feature class named &quot;TRAFFIC_COUNTS&quot; from INDOT personnel on July 1, 2016. TRAFFIC_COUNTS was loaded into Esri ArcMap and examined
for completeness, attribute accuracy, and spatial accuracy. IGS personnel then exported the data to an Esri shapefile format named &quot;TRAFFIC_COUNTS_INDOTMODEL_IN.SHP&quot;.
